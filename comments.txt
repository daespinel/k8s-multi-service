    - Login to Docker cli
    - Build the 'test' version of multi-client
    - Run tests
    - If tests are successful, run a script to deploy newest images
    - Build all our images, tag each one, push each to docker hub
    - Apply all configs in the 'k8s' folder
    - Imperatively set latest images on each deployment

# To create a service account:
    - Download service account credentials in a json file
